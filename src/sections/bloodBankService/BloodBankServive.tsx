            Blood Transfusion Services are crucial to healthcare, with no
            substitute for human blood. Advancements in transfusion technology
            demand strict quality control. Many countries have well-regulated
            blood banking systems, with some delegating management to NGOs like
            the Red Cross. The Indian government, through the Drugs Controller
            General, enforces stringent regulations under the Drugs & Cosmetics
            Act, ensuring safe collection, storage, testing, and distribution.
            Following a Supreme Court directive, amendments are being made to
            strengthen these laws. As consultants, we assist clients in
            obtaining blood bank licenses and regulatory approvals.
