            Medical devices are regulated by the Indian Government, categorized
            into A, B, C, and D classes based on risk, with licensing governed
            by central and state authorities.
            <br />
            The government has streamlined the application process through the
            SUGAM portal, making it faster and more efficient. For imports, an
            authorized Indian agent is required to apply for the license. We
            assist clients with medical device licensing and application
            procedures, ensuring a smooth and compliant process.
