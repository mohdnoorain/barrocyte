            Ensuring fair and equal access to medicines is a primary government
            concern, but selling drugs requires strict licensing. To regulate
            this, the government enforces stringent rules for granting drug
            licenses. At Barrocyte, we assist businesses in obtaining a
            hassle-free Drug License within the stipulated timeline, ensuring
            compliance with legal requirements.

            As per Section 3(b) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, a “drug”
            includes all medicines and medical devices used for humans and
            animals, both internally and externally. It also covers substances
            used for diagnosis, treatment, or disease prevention, insect
            repellents, pest control substances, and essential components like
            gelatine capsules.
